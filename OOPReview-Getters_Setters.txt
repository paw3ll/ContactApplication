Public Class Book 
{
    Private string title;
    Private string author;
    Private boolean isBorrowed;

    Public Book(string title, string author)
    {
        this.title = title;
        this.author = author;
    }

    Public void borrowBook()

        isBorrowed = true;
    }

    Public void returnBook()
    {
        isBorrowed = false;
